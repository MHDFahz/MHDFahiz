									<div>We the Keralites are facing the biggest natural disaster we have ever seen and the destruction has not stopped yet.<br>
										In late July 2018, severe flooding affected the Indian state of Kerala due to unusually high rainfall during the monsoon season. It was the worst flooding in Kerala in nearly a century, in which over 373 people died within a fortnight, while at least 280,679 people were evacuated, mainly from Chengannur, Pandanad, Aranmula, Aluva, Chalakudy, Kuttanad and Pandalam. All 14 districts of the state were placed on high alert. According to Kerala government sources, one-sixth of the total population of Kerala had been directly affected by the floods and related incidents.

Thirty-five out of the forty-two dams within the state were opened for the first time in history. All five overflow gates of the Idukki Dam were opened at the same time, for the first time in 26 years.[10] Heavy rains in Wayanad and Idukki have caused severe landslides and have left the hilly districts isolated. The situation was regularly monitored by the Prime Minister and the National Crisis Management Committee coordinated the rescue and relief operations.

Responding to the chaos around the issue of rejecting foreign assistance to the Kerala floods, the government of India, in line with the existing foreign as well as domestic policy, made it clear that it won't accept any assistance from foreign governments but is fully committed to the relief and rehabilitation by domestic resources and efforts. However, it accepts all sorts of contributions as well as humanitarian aid from individuals, NGOs and PIOs world wide.</div>

Almost all dams have been opened  since the water level has risen close to overflow level due to heavy  rainfall, flooding local low-lying areas.For the first time in the state's history, 35 of its 42 dams have been opened.Most of the regions affected by this monsoon were classified as ecologically-sensitive  zones (ESZs) by the the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, the Gadgil Committee. Most of the recommendations and directions by the commitee was either neglected or rejected.  Chairman of the committee Madhav Gadgil accused the state government and its irresponsible environmental policy for the recent landslides and floods. He called it a man-made calamity.The state government of Kerala argued in the Supreme Court that the sudden release of water from the Mullaperiyar Dam by the Tamil Nadu government was one of the reasons for the devastating flood in Kerala.</div>

			<h2><br>Rescue Operations In Kerala Saw Many Firsts, Says Top Air Force Officer:</h2>
			<div id="left"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4kF9j2ZvGp0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>The Kerala flood rescue operation was the largest disaster relief exercise the Air Force has ever conducted, with its powerful aircraft dropping a total of 2.47 lakh kg of relief material. The Air Force had to pinpoint areas that were inaccessible even by boats to rescue people in the flood-wrecked state.
The Air Force's flood relief and rescue operations in Kerala saw many firsts, a top Air Force officer said.

With 584 "winchings" -- pulling up stranded people to a hovering helicopter using a strong line -- the Air Force said it was the highest number of winchings any branch of the armed forces has ever done in a humanitarian operation.

The helicopter pilots flew with a very high situational awareness as rescuing people from homes surrounded by tall trees was a difficult and dangerous task that had no room for error. The flooded state's topography was such that all the aircraft got only a few places to land, the Air Force said.

"Everyone has done a fantastic job. Good coordination. The challenge was topography, Kerala is densely vegetated," Air Marshal B Suresh, AOC-in-C, Southern Air Command, told reporters today.</div>

			The public transport system collapsed in many parts of central Kerala with the Southern Railways and Kochi Metro suspending their operations on Thursday due to floods. Meanwhile, people in the downstream areas of the swollen Periyar river have been severely hit amid another bout of continuous rain and the opening of shutters of all major dams, including Mullaperiyar, Cheruthoni and Idamalayar.<br>
			The floods have affected the transport system to the Kochi city.<br>
			"Due to rise in water level at Bridge No 176 on Downline between Angamali and Aluva, The services on this bridge is suspended," a Southern railway spokesman said in a statement early on Thursday.<br>
			The Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) also suspended its operations this morning after its yard in Muttom near Aluva submerged in the flood waters.<br>
			The service will be resumed once the water comes down and the systems are back in good condition, its spokesperson said.<br>
			Rail traffic hit in the Malabar region also after rail tracks get flooded.<br>
